help sphereToCube
 [sideLength] = sphereToCube(radius)
 user will enter radius
 function will calculuate the volume of sphere 
 with that radius and return the side length 
 of a cube with the equivalent volume
 the variables radius and sideLength are of type double

help crateSize
 this script will calculate the side length
 of one crate that will hold all of the
 playdough balls that have been transformed into cubes
 user will input number of balls and ball radius, both are of type double
 program will output side length of entire cubed crate, which is type double
